# Java_HTTP_Server
Project 3 for CS158A
Server.java only handles 1 request at a time, so start the server for every request made.
Image file and lecture pdf are found in assets directory and Server.java will query assets directory for requested files.
Client.java will download the files into the “local” directory at the root of the project;
My implementation uses Java 8.
